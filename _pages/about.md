Hey there! I am **Arnav Sareen**, a third-year [Levine Scholar](https://levinescholars.charlotte.edu/) at UNC Charlotte majoring in both Computer Science (with a concentration in AI, Robotics, and Gaming) and Data Science, with a minor in statistics. Thank you so much for checking out my webpage!

I am passionate about learning new things and hopefully one day leveraging the things I can learn to help others. That's why I decided to pick technology as my career focus: it has an unprecedented ability to impact the lives of countless people in a way no other innovation quite has. 

I am currently involved with a few different really fun and very enjoyable activities. I am an undergraduate researcher at the [Data Intelligence Research Lab](https://sites.google.com/udel.edu/dirlab/home) at the University of Delaware, where I am supervised under Chris Egersdoerfer and Dong Dai and am working to optimize the performance of HPC I/O systems via AI methods. I worked as a Data Science Intern at Trane Technologies, where I pioneered Trane Supply's Recommendation System. I have had the immense privilege and joy of being a Teaching Assistant of a ITCS 3162 - Introduction to Data Mining (taught by the amazing [Aileen Benedict](https://aileens.space/)), a Teaching for America Ignite Fellow, and a Technical Fellow at CodePath (where I am also an E3 Scholar). I also act as the Editor-in-Chief for [ETHEL: Charlotte's Undergraduate Research Journal](https://www.etheljournal.com), where I love getting Charlotte students to share and publish their research with the wider community! 


In my free time, I love watching sports (Go Patriots!), playing video games and taking walks around the many gorgeous places in UNC Charlotte's campus, and the surrounding North Carolina landscape. 

Feel free to reach out any time about anything :) Just try to make it funny if you can!
